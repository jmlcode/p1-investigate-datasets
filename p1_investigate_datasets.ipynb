    "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
    "    <p>From the <a href=\"https://www.gapminder.org/data/\">Gapminder World</a>, which includes data for various indicators covering topics across industries and sectors, three indicators, <em>Energy</em>, <em>Environment</em> and <em>Economy</em>, were selected to gain insights into countries' environment and economy from their consumption of energy. The investigation and the findings covered in this report are divided into two sections as listed below. The specific datasets which were selected from each indicator and used in each section and the specific questions explored in each section are covered in detail in the following two sections.</p>\n",
    "    <h3>CO2 Emissions vs. Oil and Coal Consumption</h3>\n",
    "        <p>Conventional sources of energy such as oil and coal are known to be major contributors to the emissions of greenhouse gas such as CO2. This section analyzes three datasets listed below to answer several questions which aim to identify both the major consumers of these conventional energy sources and the countries with the greatest CO2 emissions, and explore the relationship between the consumption of oil and coal and the emissions of CO2.</p>\n",

    "            <li>Does larger yearly consumption of oil and coal necessarily indicate larger yearly emissions of CO2?</li>\n",

    "            </ol>\n",
    "    <h3>GDP vs. Energy Consumption</h3>\n",
    "        <p>Various sources of energy have driven technological development and have sustained the key technologies which individuals across countries and businesses across industries heavily depend on. With this role of energy becoming more significant due to various factors such as the rising population, the rising demand for more advanced technologies and the limited availability of resources, securing affordable and sustainable sources of energy is an interest shared among all countries today. Unfortunately, external factors such as diplomatic relations and internal factors such as availability of local oil reserves introduce discrepancies to countries' ability to secure affordable and sustainable sources of energy.</p>\n",
    "        <p>This section analyzes three datasets listed below to answer several questions which explore the relationship between countries' energy consumption and their GDP and aim to speculate if a country's ability to secure affordable and sustainable energy source potentially depends on or impacts the country's economy. Please note that the section does not focus on establishing a causality for these two variables.</p>\n",

Top consumer was China, and the next largest consumer was the United States. The mean annual consumption of oil and coal demonstrated by these two countries is approximately 10 times larger than that of other countries. The bar plot of the mean annual consumption of oil and coal for these five countries visually demonstrates this significant difference. The mean annual consumption of oil and coal is similar for India and Japan. Russia showed the least amount of mean annual consumption of oil and coal among the five countries.</p>"

Again, the first in rank was China, which was followed by the United States. The mean annual CO2 emissions shown by these two countries is much larger than that of other countries. The bar plot of the mean annual CO2 emissions for these five countries visually demonstrates this significant difference. Unlike the trend shown in the previous plot, Russia ranked the third in mean annual CO2 emissions while Japan showed the least amount of annual CO2 emissions among the five countries.</p>"

    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li>As expected, China and the United States' mean annual consumption of oil and coal and CO2 emissions were much larger than those of the other three countries because the curves for China and the United States are significantly above those for the other three countries. Unlike the United States with a relatively steady annual consumption of oil and coal between 1.25 and 1.5 (1e9 toe), China's annual consumption of oil and coal had significantly increased since 2001. In fact, China's annual consumption of oil and coal for 2014 was more than two times larger than that for 2001.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Russia's mean annual consumption of oil and coal was the least among all five countries because its curve lies at the bottom of the plot.</li>\n",

    "    <p>Comparison of the two plots also indicate that from 1995 to 2014, the annual trend in oil and coal consumption and the annual trend in CO2 emissions are similar for each of the five countries. For instance, the curves for the United States, Japan, and Russia are relatively horizontal in both plots. In case of China, the slope of the curves in both plots increased from 2001 to 2013. In case of India, both the annual consumption of oil and coal and the annual CO2 emissions gradually increased from 1995 to 2014. This finding aligns with the notion that conventional sources of energy such as oil and consumption contribute to the emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2.</p>"

    "    <h3>CO2 Emissions vs. Oil and Coal Consumption</h3>\n",
    "        <p>From 1995 to 2014, China and the United States showed the largest mean annual consumption of oil and coal and the largest mean annual CO2 emissions. The two countries were followed by Japan, India, and Russia although the annual consumption of oil and coal and the annual CO2 emissions in China and the United States were significantly larger than those in the other three countries. The data for these five countries suggested that the annual trends in consumption of oil and coal and CO2 emissions align with each other, confirming the notion that conventional sources of energy contribute the emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>\n",
    "        <p>Despite the positive correlation between the consumption of oil and coal and the emissions of CO2, a country with a higher consumption of oil and coal than another country may have lower CO2 emissions than the other country, a characteristic shown in Japan and Russia. The bar and line plots presented in the previous section are insufficient to fully account for this observation.</p>\n",
    "    <h3>GDP vs. Energy Consumption</h3>\n",
    "        <p>The national mean GDP/capita and mean energy use per person from 2000 to 2009 showed a strong positive relationship with a correlation coefficient of 0.855. Thus, countries observed in this dataset that show high mean energy use per person also show high GDP/capita and vice versa.</p>\n",
    "        <p>In addition, according to the scatter plot, the distributions for the mean energy use per person and the mean GDP/capita were right-skewed. The plot illustrated the existence of large gaps in the economy and in the energy use across countries especially between those in the opposite sides of the spectrum. However, the data analysis covered in the previous section did not go further to investigate whether a country's GPD/capita dictates its ability to capitalize on various energy sources or if the energy use per person shapes the country's GDP/capita.</p>"
